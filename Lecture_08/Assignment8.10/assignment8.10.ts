// Assignment 8.10: Score Checker API
// Create an API for checking student scores.
// The API expects a request body to have an array of student objecst, each with name and score.
// The API should calculate the average score, find the highest
// scoring student, and calculate the percentage of the students that had score higher or equal to the average score. The
// results should be returned in
// JSON format.
// The API should have a validator middleware that checks that the input is indeed an array that consists of objects with
// required fields. If the input
// is not valid, the API should return a response
// with appropriate status code and an error message.
