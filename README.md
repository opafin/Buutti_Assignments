✨ Lecture 1 Wednesday 3.5 highlight <br>

Bootcamp buddy suggested I could try to make an NPM package out of the lecture folder generators I was testing out.

Here it is:

```bash
npm install buufolders
````
```bash
npx buuf 1 10
```
```
1 = thisLecture
10 = totalAssignmentCount
```

✨ Lecture 1 Thursday 4.5 highlight <br>

The final task of the lecture 1 sparked a lot of creativity in the Buutcampers <br>
<br>
We came up with several ideas for calculating rounded up group counts from a population <br>
regardless of having many restrictions such as <br>
* no library functions
* no if-statements
* no loops <br>
<br>
Some tried pure math solutions and others cleverly used string replacement. <br>
<br>
Here is my favourite solution <br>

<br>
Starting Teamwork with Github and GitLab early. It's challenging, and it's great. <br>
I made this "thank you" card for the team in jest with the canva free trial :)
