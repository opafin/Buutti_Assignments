// created two repos

// gitlab first ->> cloned to the local machine (+via SSH by adding SSH to gitlab) (+via HTTPS)

// vscode first ->> created a folder,
// opened it in vscode, created a file,
// added some code, saved it,
// added it to git, committed it, pushed it to gitlab

// only gitlab proj first + folder made earlier on local machine-->
// ****no button to add folders on gitlab, only files.****
// had to use terminal commands to push.

// vscode terminal: cd existing_repo
// git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/opafin/so-much-awesomeness.git
// git branch -M main
// git push -uf origin main
