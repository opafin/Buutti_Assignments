// Assignment 9.8: Securing a Route
// Modify the Students API /register and /login routes
// so that on success they return a response with status code 200 and a JWT with username as payload.
// Secure all the routes in the students router
// so that they require the user to be logged in to use the routes.
//
// Extra: Also modify the /admin route to return a JWT.
// Secure the POST, PUT and DELETE routes to require that in addition to being logged in,
// the user also needs to be an admin.
// Hint: Here you have some resources on sending a token with Postman.
