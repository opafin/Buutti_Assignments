âœ¨ Lecture 1 Wednesday 3.5 highlight <br>

Bootcamp buddy suggested I could try to make an NPM package out of one the lecture folder generators I was creating for us to use, since we would be making a lot of folders.
  
*ver 1.0.1 formats lectures, assignments and files with zeroes 01 for better organization in Github*   
*ver 1.0.2 checks if any type of assignment files already exist, providing safety from excess files.*  
*ver 1.0.3 accepts an optional type parameter. **npx buuf 3 10 .ts** //this works with the "." and without.*  
*ver 1.0.4 clarified comments*  
*ver 1.0.5 now works with empty spaces in foldernames. (made the .cmd file take the path as string instead of plain)*

```bash
npm install buufolders
````
```bash
npx buuf 1 10
```
```
1 = thisLecture
10 = totalAssignmentCount
```
